## OverView
C19 Watcher is an application that is suitable for Post Pandemic work Environment.
Our Goal is to achieve a safe work Environment where all the social norms such as Social Distancing, Wearing a Mask, and checking body temperature is done through minimal human interaction.
For this we have created various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models which can be implemented on any camera module and all of this is integrated into a fast serverless application known as C19 Watcher.
